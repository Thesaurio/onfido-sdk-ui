/**
 * We want our units to be based on `em`, so that our SDK can accommodate for
 * the user changing their browser font size.
 * At the same time, `px` is a unit often used in templates etc. from Design.
 * To accommodate for both of these cases, we make our @unit be 1/16 of an `em`.
 * This results in each @unit into being the same as 1px (when the parent
 * font-size is 16px, as it is by default).
 *
 * So each "unit" isn't a pixel, but it is when the parent font size is 16px,
 * and it's proportionate to the difference otherwise.
